# kp-detector-under-projection-transformation
This is a comparative experiment on keypoint detectors under projection transformation.
## step 1
CameraControls.cs is the main code for the Unity project used to generate transformation matrices, and the output results are saved in matrix.xlsx
## step 2
run create_dataset.ipynb to create the dataset.
## step 3
run the keypoint detectors to get the keypoints.
## step 4
run repeatity_all.py to calculate the repeatity of keypoints.
## step 5
run data_visual_xxx.ipynb to visualize the results.
